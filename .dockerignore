# used for building imagew, but not needed inside the images
docker

# This needs to be discussed.
# At this point the tests are ran locally by developer (see `make start-dev`)
# and are NOT included in the build. At some point we may want to
# build a derivative image (based on prod image) that adds tests folder
# and runs the tests in the cloud, but that does not have to be
# baked into the image. Base image can just be ran with /tests mounted
# into it and ran as such... anyway, excluding for now.
